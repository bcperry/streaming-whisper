# Phase 1.4 Completion: Logging & Error Handling Standardization

## Summary
Successfully implemented structured logging configuration and standardized error handling patterns throughout the streaming-whisper codebase. This phase replaced basic logging.basicConfig() calls with a comprehensive logging system and improved exception handling with proper categorization and context.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Created Structured Logging System
- **New Module**: `src/utils/logging.py` - Comprehensive logging utilities
- **StructuredFormatter**: Custom formatter with component and client_id tracking
- **StreamingWhisperLogger**: Centralized logger configuration with file rotation
- **Log Separation**: Separate handlers for API and transcription logs
- **Context Management**: LoggingContextManager for adding structured context

### 2. Custom Exception Classes
- **StreamingWhisperError**: Base exception for application
- **TranscriptionError**: Specific to transcription operations  
- **WebSocketError**: Specific to WebSocket operations
- **ConfigurationError**: Specific to configuration issues

### 3. Error Handling Utilities
- **log_exception()**: Structured exception logging with context
- **error_handler()**: Context manager for consistent error handling
- **Component tracking**: All errors now include component and client_id context

### 4. Updated transcription.py
- ✅ Replaced `logging.basicConfig()` with structured logging
- ✅ Updated exception handling in `transcribe()` method
- ✅ Added proper error categorization (TranscriptionError)
- ✅ Improved callback error handling with structured logging

### 5. Updated api.py  
- ✅ Replaced `logging.basicConfig()` with structured logging
- ✅ Enhanced file I/O error handling with specific exception types
- ✅ Improved WebSocket error handling with proper categorization
- ✅ Added client_id context to all error logging
- ✅ Better audio processing error handling with recovery

## New Logging Format
```
2025-09-20 17:53:17 | INFO     | api          | N/A        | Set transcription callback for client 1758408796157
2025-09-20 17:53:26 | ERROR    | websocket_main | 1758408796157 | Exception in websocket_main: RuntimeError: Cannot call "receive" once a disconnect message has been received.
```

**Format**: `timestamp | level | component | client_id | message`

## Error Handling Improvements

### Before (Generic)
```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
```

### After (Structured)
```python
except (OSError, IOError) as e:
    log_exception(logger, e, component="file_storage", client_id=client_id)
    raise WebSocketError(f"Failed to save transcription: {str(e)}") from e
```

## Testing Results
✅ **Server Startup**: Successfully starts with uvicorn
✅ **Module Import**: transcription.py imports without errors
✅ **MicWhisper Creation**: Initializes successfully
✅ **Structured Logging**: New format visible in api.log
✅ **Error Logging**: Exception details properly captured with context

## Log File Organization
- **api.log**: API server operations, WebSocket connections, file storage
- **transcription.log**: Whisper model operations, audio processing, transcription results
- **Console**: Simple format for development monitoring
- **Rotation**: 10MB files with 5 backup copies to prevent disk issues

## Key Benefits Achieved
1. **Better Debugging**: Structured logs with component and client context
2. **Error Categorization**: Specific exception types for different failure modes
3. **Context Preservation**: Full stack traces with structured metadata
4. **Log Management**: File rotation prevents disk space issues
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Different logs for different components
6. **Production Ready**: Proper error handling that doesn't crash the application

## Next Steps
Phase 1.4 completes the **Critical Foundation** phase. The application now has:
- ✅ Clear file naming (transcription.py)
- ✅ Separated HTML templates 
- ✅ Centralized configuration management
- ✅ Structured logging and error handling

**Ready for Phase 2**: Code Organization and structure improvements.

## Recommended Next Session Prompt

> I'm working on a streaming-whisper repository that provides real-time audio transcription using OpenAI Whisper with WebSocket support. Please review the IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md file to understand the overall improvement strategy and implement the most important remaining change (Phase 2.1 - Code Organization).
> 
> Begin Phase 2 by reorganizing the codebase structure, moving core logic into appropriate modules, separating business logic from API endpoints, and creating proper module separation. Update import statements and ensure all functionality remains intact.

This next change will improve code maintainability, enable easier testing, and create clear separation of concerns in the application architecture.
