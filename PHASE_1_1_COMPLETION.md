# Phase 1.1 Completion Report

## âœ… Completed: TTS.py â†’ transcription.py Rename

### What Was Done:
1. **Renamed the main transcription file** from `TTS.py` to `transcription.py`
2. **Updated imports** in `api.py` from `from TTS import MicWhisper` to `from transcription import MicWhisper`
3. **Updated log file naming** from `tts.log` to `transcription.log` for consistency
4. **Cleaned up cache files** to ensure clean imports
5. **Thoroughly tested** the changes:
   - âœ… Module imports correctly
   - âœ… FastAPI application starts without errors
   - âœ… Web interface loads and displays correctly
   - âœ… WebSocket connections establish successfully
   - âœ… Whisper model loads correctly
   - âœ… Transcription callbacks are set up properly

### Impact:
- **Immediate clarity improvement**: The filename now accurately reflects that this module handles transcription (ASR), not text-to-speech (TTS)
- **Better maintainability**: Developers can now easily understand the module's purpose from its name
- **Reduced confusion**: No more misleading file names

### Files Modified:
- `TTS.py` â†’ `transcription.py` (renamed with updated log file reference)
- `api.py` (updated import statement)
- `tts.log` â†’ `transcription.log` (renamed for consistency)

### Testing Results:
All functionality verified working:
- Web server starts successfully
- WebSocket connections work
- Transcription model loads correctly
- No breaking changes introduced

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Priority: Extract HTML Template (Phase 1.2)

The next most impactful change is to extract the large embedded HTML template from `api.py` into a separate file. This will significantly improve code organization and maintainability.

### Recommended Prompt for Next Session:
```
Extract the embedded HTML template from api.py into a separate static file. Create a proper static file serving structure with src/web/static/index.html and update the FastAPI route to serve the static file instead of the embedded HTML string. Test that the web interface continues to work correctly after the extraction.
```

This change will:
- Separate presentation from logic
- Make the HTML easier to edit and maintain
- Reduce the size of the main API file
- Follow web development best practices
- Enable syntax highlighting for HTML in editors
