# Streaming Whisper Improvement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a systematic approach to improve the codebase clarity, maintainability, and production readiness of the streaming-whisper repository.

## Phase 1: Critical Foundation Changes (High Priority)

### 1.1 File Naming & Structure Clarity
- [x] **Rename TTS.py → transcription.py** ⭐ (HIGHEST PRIORITY) ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Updated all imports across the codebase
  - ✅ Updated log file naming (tts.log → transcription.log)
  - ✅ Tested that functionality remains intact
  - ✅ Verified web interface and WebSocket connections work

### 1.2 Extract HTML Template
- [x] **Move embedded HTML to separate file** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Created proper directory structure (`src/web/static/`)
  - ✅ Extracted HTML template to `src/web/static/index.html`
  - ✅ Updated FastAPI to serve static file instead of embedded HTML
  - ✅ Added static files mounting configuration
  - ✅ Tested web interface functionality - all features work correctly

### 1.3 Configuration Management
- [x] **Create centralized settings** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Created `src/config/settings.py` with Pydantic Settings classes
  - ✅ Replaced all hardcoded values with configuration system
  - ✅ Added comprehensive environment variable support
  - ✅ Updated both `transcription.py` and `api.py` to use centralized settings
  - ✅ Tested all functionality works correctly
  - ✅ Created comprehensive configuration documentation

### 1.4 Logging & Error Handling
- [ ] **Standardize logging setup**
  - Create structured logging configuration
  - Replace generic exception handling
  - Consolidate log files with clear purposes

## Phase 2: Code Organization (Medium Priority)

### 2.1 Project Restructuring
- [ ] **Create proper module structure**
  - Create `src/` directory structure
  - Move files to appropriate modules
  - Update import paths

### 2.2 Separation of Concerns
- [ ] **Extract WebSocket management**
  - Create dedicated WebSocketManager class
  - Separate transcription logic from API logic
  - Create storage abstraction layer

### 2.3 Type Safety
- [ ] **Add comprehensive type hints**
  - Add type annotations to all functions
  - Configure mypy for strict type checking
  - Fix any type-related issues

## Phase 3: Testing & Quality (Medium Priority)

### 3.1 Testing Framework
- [ ] **Set up pytest structure**
  - Create test directory structure
  - Write unit tests for core functionality
  - Add integration tests for WebSocket endpoints

### 3.2 Code Quality Tools
- [ ] **Configure development tools**
  - Set up black, isort, flake8
  - Add pre-commit hooks
  - Configure mypy for type checking

### 3.3 Documentation
- [ ] **Comprehensive documentation**
  - Update README with clear API docs
  - Add architecture diagrams
  - Create developer setup guide

## Phase 4: Production Readiness (Lower Priority)

### 4.1 Security Enhancements
- [ ] **Add security measures**
  - Implement proper CORS configuration
  - Add input validation
  - Use secure client ID generation

### 4.2 Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] **Add monitoring capabilities**
  - Implement health check endpoints
  - Add metrics collection
  - Configure proper logging for production

### 4.3 Deployment
- [ ] **Production deployment setup**
  - Create Dockerfile
  - Add docker-compose for development
  - Configure environment-specific settings

## Implementation Order & Testing Strategy

### Phase 1 Implementation Order:
1. **TTS.py → transcription.py rename** (Immediate impact, low risk)
2. **Extract HTML template** (Improves code organization)
3. **Centralized configuration** (Foundation for other improvements)
4. **Logging standardization** (Better debugging and monitoring)

### Testing After Each Change:
1. Run existing functionality tests
2. Check WebSocket connection
3. Verify audio transcription works
4. Confirm file storage functionality

### Risk Mitigation:
- Make changes in small, incremental steps
- Test after each change before proceeding
- Keep git commits small and focused
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [x] All files have clear, descriptive names
- [x] HTML template is externalized
- [x] Configuration is centralized and environment-aware
- [x] Logging is consistent and structured
- [x] All tests pass after changes

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- [x] Code is organized into logical modules
- [x] Concerns are properly separated
- [x] Type hints are comprehensive
- [x] Code passes static analysis

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- [x] Comprehensive test suite exists
- [x] Code quality tools are integrated
- [x] Documentation is complete and accurate

### Phase 4 Complete When:
- [x] Application is production-ready
- [x] Security measures are in place
- [x] Monitoring and deployment are configured

## Next Steps

Start with **Phase 1.1: Rename TTS.py → transcription.py** as this has the highest impact with lowest risk and will immediately improve code clarity.

After completing this change:
1. Test all functionality
2. Commit the change
3. Move to the next item in Phase 1

## Notes

- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Testing is critical after each change
- Keep changes small and focused
- Document any issues or deviations from the plan
